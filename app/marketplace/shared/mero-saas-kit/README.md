## 🚧 Status: Alpha

**Mero SaaS Kit** is currently under active development. It is designed to be the foundational template for creating new applications within the Mero Jugx ecosystem.

---

## 📖 Overview

When fully released, Mero SaaS Kit will provide:
1. **Scaffold Scripts**: Command-line tools to generate a new App structure in `apps/`.
2. **Template Components**: Pre-wired components that adhere to the platform's design system.
3. **Example Logic**: Reference implementations of Multi-tenancy, Auth, and Billing integration.

## 📂 Design Goals

- **Zero Config Start**: Create a new app that works with the platform core in minutes.
- **Strict Typing**: Full TypeScript support with shared DTOs.
- **Unified Look & Feel**: Automatic inheritance of the platform's theming and layout.

---

## 🚀 Usage (Preview)

Currently, this directory serves as a sandbox for testing new patterns before they are promoted to `mero-board` or the platform core.

```bash
# Start the Kit logic (if available)
npm run dev:saas-kit
```
